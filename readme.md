# Github Dashboard

## Why ?

By developing this project, I would like to create a fully customized dashboard based on real data from my Github account. Like we easily can access to developer's data, I will create an adaptable version of the wap in the way to render it usable for everyone.

## Prerequisites:

This web app uses Javascript Node server and express service for creating the server.

## V1

This first version of the project will provide some statistics of Github developers. Each developer will be able to add its username to the homepage form. After that, the user will be redirected to its custom dashboard with some basics stats about its projects and its code habits.

The v1 will provide following features:
- Number of public repositories
- Average size of public repositories
- Repository initialization frequency
- Bar chart of used languages
- Line chart representing creation hour of repositories
- (maybe PR infos)

## In the future

I will  develop some new versions of this webapp to provide to users more statistics, even private ones with private access to the user'API service.
